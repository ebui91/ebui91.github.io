# Eric Bui | My Personal Portfolio

VIEW THE PROJECT HERE: http://www.ericbui.com/

## Overview
My personal portfolio project made with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I hope to incorporate some animations into this project, so I might bring in other libraries in the future. This project is NOT completed yet! I plan on adding a few more things before showing it to employers.

## Description
In this day and age of bootstrap templates, why would anyone ACTUALLY make their own portfolio?! Well to be honest, I enjoy front-end development, and I love the creative process involved in web design! This project was a lot of fun for me to make, and it was refreshing to focus on only the HTML/CSS of a static webpage, as opposed to creating a logic-heavy JavaScript application.

## Versions
v1.0: Static framework for the website has been built. (12.25.17)
<br />
v1.1: Completed styling and added iFrames linking to other projects. (12.30.17)
<br />
